### 📰 About:
❓ When you press a key on the keyboard, information about that key is displayed, such as:
* VK Key: The code associated with the key according to Virtual-Key Codes.
* Key Name: The name of the key, like "A", "Shift", "F1", etc.
* ID: A unique identifier for the pressed key.
* Constant: The value of the constant associated with the key.
* Hex: The hexadecimal of the key.

There are certainly several errors and things to optimize and add, I do not for the moment intend to work on this project again.
